## My Recommendations for Military Personnel:

### Most Professional: **MIDNIGHT STEEL** or **DEEP SLATE**
- Understated, serious, no bright colours
- Works well in low-light environments
- Doesn't feel "techy" or consumer-app-like

### Most Calming: **WARM DEPTHS** or **ARCTIC DEPTHS**  
- Warm depths feels more human/comforting
- Arctic is cleaner, more clinical

### Most Distinctive: **NAUTICAL BRASS** or **SLATE & COPPER**
- References naval tradition
- Copper/brass adds warmth without being "bright"
- Feels premium, one-time-purchase worthy
